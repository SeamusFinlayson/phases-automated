# Phases Automated

_Build encounters with complex automations managed through a simple menu_

## How It Works

### Extension Anatomy

### Good to Know

- When a token enters a new phase, its properties are initialized based on its current state
- A token can only be part of one automation
- The context menu can either add a token to the currently selected automation, or remove it from any automation
- Removing a property from the automation only deletes token data for the current phase. This means that if the property is added back to the automation, switching to other phases will set the token's state based on old data. Cycle through all phases after removing it to completely delete that property.
